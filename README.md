Glovebox
=========

A high-level wrapper around [libtfhe](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe/). This is extremely **experimental**, alpha, and by all means not release-ready - feel free to peek at the features, but don't rely on its API.

Check out the examples folder to see it in action.

## Usage

 * Install the requirements detailed in `tools/verilog-to-glovebox`
 * `cd tools/verilog-to-glovebox`
 * `./transpile.sh ../../src/autogenerated/add.{v,cpp}`
 * `./transpile.sh ../../src/autogenerated/mul.{v,cpp}`
 * `cd ../..`
 * Install TFHE v1 (https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe/tree/v1.0.1)
 * Install the GSL
 * Install rpclib
 * `cmake . -DPLAINTEXT=0` (PLAINTEXT=1 uses a mock implementation and enables debug flags)

## Misc notes

Uses a custom version of gsl::span for syntactic reasons. If it ever needs to be updated, apply the patch in gsl_span.diff to gsl/span from the Microsoft GSL.
